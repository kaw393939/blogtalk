## What is BlogTalk?

BlogTalk is a minimal, fast, and elegant blog built with **Next.js** and **GitHub Pages**. Write your posts in Markdown, push to GitHub, and your blog updates automatically.

## Getting Started

- Edit `content/pages/home.md` to customize this homepage
- Add new `.md` files to `content/posts/` to create blog posts
- Each post uses frontmatter for metadata (title, date, excerpt, tags)
- Push to GitHub and your site deploys automatically via GitHub Actions
