I grew up in a data center — my father was a mainframe systems lead operator for Alcoa. Got a TRS-80 for Christmas in 1983 and taught myself to program. I've been building things ever since.

At NJIT since 2002, I created the Web Systems program, built 8 courses, and taught over 10,000 students. My alumni are at Amazon, Google, JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, and hundreds of other companies. I'm now evolving the program into the Enterprise AI degree.

When ChatGPT launched, I started using it within days. Less hype, more reality.
