The leaders of major AI labs have offered remarkably optimistic timelines for artificial general intelligence:

- Shane Legg (DeepMind): 50% chance of AGI by 2028
- Dario Amodei (Anthropic): Human-level AI possible in 2-3 years
- Sam Altman (OpenAI): AGI could arrive in 4-5 years

These get the headlines. Here's what doesn't: a 2023 survey of over 2,700 AI researchers found the median prediction for "high-level machine intelligence" was around **2047**. Predictions ranged from the 2030s to beyond 2100. There's significant disagreement even on what would qualify as AGI.

Both sets of predictions can't be right. And it's worth understanding why the gap matters.

## The Incentive Problem

The first thing to recognize: the people making the most aggressive predictions have commercial and personal incentives to generate excitement. If you're raising billions in funding for AI research, "AGI in 3 years" is a much better pitch than "probably a few decades, with significant uncertainty."

This doesn't mean they're lying. It means their perspective is structurally biased toward optimism. The 2,700 researcher survey includes people with no financial stake in the answer.

## What Current AI Actually Can't Do

Despite genuinely impressive capabilities, current AI systems:

- **Lack genuine understanding.** They predict patterns. They don't comprehend meaning.
- **Struggle with basic reasoning and common sense.** Ask an LLM a novel logic puzzle and watch it confidently produce nonsense.
- **Cannot reliably plan long-term or pursue complex goals.** They're reactive, not strategic.
- **Experience catastrophic forgetting** when learning new information.
- **Require massive computational resources** that raise sustainability concerns.
- **Generate false information confidently.** Hallucination isn't a bug being fixed — it's a fundamental characteristic of how these systems work.

None of these are minor technical issues being cleaned up in the next release. They're structural limitations of the current architecture.

## The Obstacles Nobody Talks About

**Fundamental scientific barriers.** We may be missing key insights about intelligence, reasoning, or consciousness. Current approaches (transformer architectures, scale-based improvement) may not be sufficient paths to AGI regardless of how much compute you throw at them.

**Computational limits.** Energy requirements for training ever-larger models may become prohibitive. Training GPT-4 consumed enormous resources. Training a model 1,000x larger isn't just expensive — it may not be physically practical.

**Data exhaustion.** We may run out of quality training data. The internet is large but finite, and much of it is now AI-generated content of questionable quality.

**Diminishing returns.** Scaling current architectures may hit capability plateaus. There's growing evidence this is already happening with some benchmarks.

## The Cure-Everything Fantasy

Some AI leaders have made extraordinary claims — superintelligent AI "ending all disease within a decade" or achieving "mortality escape velocity." These deserve scrutiny.

Even with perfect AI assistance, biological complexity means many diseases involve intricate genetics-environment-lifestyle interactions that can't simply be "solved" computationally. Validating treatments safely requires years of clinical trials. Safety testing and regulatory approval won't be bypassed regardless of AI capabilities. And deploying new treatments globally requires manufacturing, distribution, and infrastructure.

AI will likely accelerate drug discovery, enable more personalized medicine, and improve diagnostic accuracy. It will probably not end all disease by 2035 or achieve immortality on any realistic timeframe.

## A Realistic Timeline

Rather than a sudden explosion in 5-10 years, a more realistic scenario involves:

- Continued steady improvements in AI capabilities over 15-30 years
- Gradual expansion from narrow AI to somewhat more general systems
- Periodic plateaus when current approaches hit limits
- Potential breakthroughs that accelerate progress at unpredictable moments
- AGI possibly emerging in the 2040s-2060s (if it's achievable at all)
- Superintelligence, if possible, likely decades after AGI

This isn't pessimism. It's realism. And the distinction matters, because realistic expectations lead to better preparation. If AGI is 3 years away, we're catastrophically unprepared. If it's 25 years away, we have time to build governance frameworks, retraining programs, and safety research.

The path forward requires what I'd call realistic optimism: acknowledging the genuine potential while maintaining clear eyes about the timeline, the obstacles, and the gap between what makes a good headline and what's actually likely to happen.
