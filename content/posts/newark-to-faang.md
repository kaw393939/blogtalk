title: "From Newark to FAANG: Building Bridges That Actually Work"
date: "2026-01-30"
excerpt: "I've taught 10,000+ students at NJIT over 23 years. They're at Amazon, Google, JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs. But I'm done watching qualified students get ghosted and talented Newark residents get overlooked. So I'm building real bridges."

Let me tell you about a pattern I've seen play out a thousand times.

A student works through my program at NJIT. They learn to build real systems. They understand software engineering not as an academic exercise but as a craft. They graduate. They apply to companies. And then — silence. Ghosted. Overlooked. Not because they lack skill, but because they lack connections, brand-name internships, or the unspoken signals that hiring managers use as shortcuts.

Meanwhile, those same companies complain they can't find talent.

I've been watching this for 23 years. I'm done watching.

## The Pipeline Is Real

My students aren't abstractions on a roster. They're working at Amazon, Google, JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, and hundreds of other companies. They're CTOs, senior engineers, data scientists. Many are building their own companies right here in Newark.

Over two decades at NJIT, I've created 8 regularly offered courses at both undergraduate and graduate level, teaching 15 sections annually. The curricula I built attracted Fortune 100 recruiting pipelines. The Web Systems program became a proven path from Newark to the technology industry.

But a pipeline isn't a bridge. A pipeline moves people through a system. A bridge connects two sides that couldn't reach each other before.

## What I Actually Mean by Bridges

**Between students and hiring managers.** Not job boards. Real introductions. I have a 900+ LinkedIn network of alumni, industry contacts, and hiring managers. When I say a student is ready, that means something — because I've been vetting talent for two decades and my track record speaks for itself.

**Between AI hype and practical reality.** Every company wants "AI transformation." Most don't know what that means in practice. I bridge that gap through my Town Hall series and corporate training — showing organizations what AI can actually do today, what it can't, and how to build teams that use it effectively.

**Between Newark's untapped potential and New Jersey's tech ecosystem.** Newark has talent. The tech industry has opportunity. The gap between them isn't ability — it's access, exposure, and the kind of mentorship that turns potential into careers.

## The Teaching That Shaped This

My teaching experience extends beyond any single classroom. I've worked with high schools, served as an AmeriCorps member at an urban after-school youth center in Pittsburgh teaching computers to children, and taught software engineering internationally to government employees in Zambia, implementing an e-government system and introducing UX design practices.

Each of these experiences reinforced the same lesson: **technology is a democratizer, but only if someone builds the on-ramp.** The technology doesn't care about your zip code, your background, or your parents' network. But the institutions around technology absolutely do — and that's where the work needs to happen.

## The Enterprise AI Evolution

I'm now evolving the Web Systems program into the Enterprise AI degree. This isn't a rebrand — it's a natural progression driven by research work and industry projects using Generative AI to train, augment, and automate software engineering and product development processes.

My capstone courses implement advanced ETL pipelines combining LLM and machine learning techniques for NLP and knowledge graph construction to support RAG workflows. That's not buzzwords — that's students building real systems that solve real problems, the same way they've always done in my program. The tools changed. The mission didn't.

When ChatGPT launched, I started using it within days. As an early adopter of vibe coding, I've combined deep knowledge of enterprise software engineering with innovative uses of Generative AI — AI-augmented QA review, advanced techniques for day-to-day engineering workflows, and frameworks for building with AI as a genuine collaborator, not just a fancy autocomplete.

## What Hasn't Changed

My father was a mainframe systems lead operator for Alcoa. I grew up in a data center. I got a TRS-80 Color Computer 2 for Christmas in 1983 and taught myself to program. I've been building systems ever since — early internet, first iPhone, one of the first MEAN stack frameworks, SaaS platforms, iOS apps.

Through all of that, the constant has been the same: **technology creates opportunity, and opportunity should be accessible to everyone who's willing to do the work.**

That's not a mission statement. That's 23 years of showing up, teaching 15 sections a year, and watching students surprise everyone — including themselves — with what they can build.

The bridges aren't metaphorical. I'm building them. One student, one connection, one honest conversation at a time.
