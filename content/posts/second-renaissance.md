title: "The Second Renaissance: AI Is the New Printing Press"
date: "2026-02-16"
excerpt: "The printing press produced 20 million volumes by 1500 and sparked the first Renaissance. ChatGPT hit 100 million users in two months. We're living through the opening chapter of the second one — but the timeline is decades, not years."

In the 15th century, the printing press unleashed an information revolution that transformed society. By 1500, presses across Europe had produced over 20 million volumes. A century later, that output had surged nearly tenfold. Knowledge that once spread at a trickle now flowed freely, fueling leaps in literacy, science, and art. The Renaissance was born — a flourishing of human creativity enabled by new technology.

Today, we're standing at the dawn of what I believe is a Second Renaissance, driven not by movable type but by artificial intelligence. The pace is unprecedented: when OpenAI released ChatGPT in late 2022, it reached 100 million users in two months — the fastest-growing consumer application in history. TikTok took nine months. The internet itself took years.

But here's the part that the hype cycle leaves out: **unlike the gradual 300-year unfolding of the first Renaissance, the timeline and ultimate impact of this one remain deeply uncertain.** The potential is enormous. So are the challenges.

## The Numbers Are Real

This isn't theoretical. AI-powered medical devices approved by the FDA went from 6 in 2015 to 223 in 2023. Waymo's autonomous vehicles provide over 150,000 rides per week. By 2024, 78% of organizations reported using AI in at least one function, up from 55% the year before. Private AI investment in the US hit $109 billion in 2024 — twelve times China's.

And the capability curve is genuinely exponential. GPT-3.5 scored in the bottom 10% on the bar exam. GPT-4, released months later, scored in the top 10%.

## But Most Adoption Is Shallow

Here's the reality check. Most business AI use remains superficial — basic chatbots, simple automation, pilot projects that haven't scaled. The gap between theoretical capability and reliable real-world deployment is substantial. Organizations report difficulties integrating AI into existing workflows, accuracy concerns, and a shortage of employees who can actually use these tools effectively.

When skilled professionals use AI assistants, they save about 5.4% of work hours — roughly 2.2 hours out of a 40-hour week. That's real, but it's not the revolution that headlines promise. As of early 2024, only about 5% of firms had formally integrated generative AI into their workflows.

Goldman Sachs projects that generative AI could raise global GDP by 7% over a decade. McKinsey sizes the opportunity at $4.4 trillion in added annual productivity. But those projections assume widespread adoption, continued rapid improvement, successful integration into existing processes, favorable regulation, and solutions to reliability problems. That's a lot of assumptions.

## The Historical Parallel That Matters

The internet took roughly 20 years to deliver substantial productivity gains after its introduction. AI may follow a similar pattern — meaningful but gradual improvements rather than an immediate revolution.

The first Renaissance emerged gradually from medieval society, with fits and starts, regional variations, and centuries of adaptation. It brought tremendous human flourishing, but also disruption, inequality, and conflict. Our Second Renaissance will likely follow a similar arc.

The story is still being written. The outcomes will be determined not by AI alone, but by the choices we make collectively about how to develop, deploy, and govern these tools.

The pen — or the keyboard, or the algorithm — is in our hands. The question is whether we have the wisdom to use it well.
