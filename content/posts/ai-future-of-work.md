Whenever a powerful new technology arrives, the first question everyone asks is: what happens to workers? The estimates around generative AI are staggering — globally, around 300 million full-time jobs could be affected by automation in the coming years. Roles involving routine data processing, prediction, or content generation are particularly exposed.

That number is real, and it deserves serious attention. But it also deserves historical context.

## The Statistic That Changes Everything

Economist David Autor calculated that about 60% of today's workers are in occupations that didn't exist in 1940. By Goldman Sachs' analysis, more than 85% of employment growth since 1940 is explained by technology-driven creation of new positions.

Each wave of innovation — electricity, automobiles, computers, the internet — eliminated some jobs but spawned others, often in ways nobody predicted in advance. Nobody in 1990 was planning a career as a social media manager, a cloud architect, or a prompt engineer. Those categories didn't exist. They emerged because new technology created new needs.

## The Messy Middle

The long-term trend is encouraging. The short-term transition is where people get hurt.

Goldman Sachs forecasts unemployment might tick up by about 0.5 percentage points during the AI transition, with roughly 6-7% of the U.S. workforce potentially displaced in the short run. They expect the impact to be transitory — within a couple of years, the labor market historically adjusts. But "transitory" is cold comfort when you're the one whose job disappeared.

What's often missing from the optimistic narratives:

- **Geographic disparities.** Job losses concentrate in certain regions while new jobs emerge elsewhere.
- **The skills gap.** Displaced workers may lack the training to fill emerging roles without substantial retraining programs.
- **Quality of new jobs.** Not all new positions offer comparable wages or working conditions.
- **Political backlash.** Job displacement historically triggers protectionist policies and political instability that can slow adoption.

## What's Already Emerging

We can see outlines of new employment categories forming right now:

- Prompt engineering and AI interface design
- AI ethics and safety specialists
- AI system auditors and validators
- Human-AI collaboration specialists across fields
- AI maintenance and fine-tuning technicians
- Context engineers who build the environments that make AI productive

That last one is particularly interesting to me. It's not just about writing prompts — it's about engineering the entire context in which an AI operates: the tools, the quality gates, the testing infrastructure, the feedback loops. That's a genuine skill that takes months to develop.

## The Key Question

The question isn't whether jobs will exist in an AI-augmented economy. History strongly suggests they will, in forms we can't yet imagine. The key question is whether the transition can be managed humanely — with adequate support for displaced workers, robust retraining programs, and social safety nets during the adjustment period.

The societies that navigated previous technological revolutions most successfully shared common characteristics: strong public education, social safety nets, progressive policies to distribute gains broadly, and democratic processes giving citizens voice in technological direction.

We've done this before. We can do it again. But only if we start now, with clear eyes about both the opportunity and the pain.
