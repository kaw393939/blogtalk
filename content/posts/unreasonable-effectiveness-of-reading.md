excerpt: "The most novel solutions rarely come from domain experts. They come from people who import ideas across boundaries — and that starts with reading outside your field."

In 1965, the physicist Eugene Wigner wrote a famous paper titled "The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences." His central puzzle: why does abstract mathematics — developed without any concern for physical reality — turn out to describe the universe with such uncanny precision?

I've observed a similar phenomenon in my own work, though far less grand: **the unreasonable effectiveness of reading widely.**

## Adjacent Possible

Stuart Kauffman introduced the concept of the "adjacent possible" — the set of all things that are one step away from what currently exists. Innovation doesn't happen in leaps; it happens by exploring the boundaries of what's adjacent to what you already know.

But here's the key insight: **the size of your adjacent possible is proportional to the diversity of your existing knowledge.**

If you only read about software engineering, your adjacent possible is limited to recombinations of software engineering ideas. But if you also read about evolutionary biology, urban planning, and jazz improvisation, your adjacent possible explodes. Suddenly you're seeing patterns that specialists miss entirely.

## Cross-Pollination in Practice

Some of the most consequential ideas in technology came from outside technology:

- **Agile methodology** draws heavily from lean manufacturing (Toyota Production System), itself influenced by W. Edwards Deming's statistical quality control work
- **Neural networks** were inspired by biological neurons, though the connection is more metaphorical than literal at this point
- **The PageRank algorithm** was modeled on academic citation analysis — Google treated links as citations and applied bibliometrics to the web
- **Object-oriented programming** was influenced by Plato's theory of Forms — the idea that abstract templates (classes) give rise to concrete instances (objects)

None of these innovations required deep expertise in the source domain. They required *awareness* — enough understanding to recognize a transferable pattern.

## Building a Reading Practice

My reading habit is deliberately eclectic. In any given month, I might read:

- A technical paper on distributed systems
- A history of the Ottoman Empire
- A cognitive science book on decision-making
- A collection of essays by an architect or urban planner
- A novel (literary fiction forces you to inhabit unfamiliar perspectives — an underrated professional skill)

The goal isn't to become an expert in Ottoman history. It's to stock my mind with diverse mental models that can be recombined in unexpected ways.

## The Compounding Effect

Reading widely has a compounding quality. Each new domain you explore doesn't just add knowledge linearly — it multiplies connections. If you understand three domains, you have three potential cross-domain connections. Add a fourth, and you have six. A fifth gives you ten.

This is combinatorial growth, and it's why the most interesting people I know — the ones who generate genuinely novel ideas — are invariably voracious, omnivorous readers.

## A Starting Point

If you're primarily a technical reader, here are five books from outside technology that have profoundly influenced how I think about my work:

1. **"Thinking in Systems" by Donella Meadows** — systems dynamics applied to everything
2. **"The Structure of Scientific Revolutions" by Thomas Kuhn** — how paradigm shifts actually happen
3. **"Seeing Like a State" by James C. Scott** — why top-down planning fails and local knowledge matters
4. **"Range" by David Epstein** — the case for generalism over specialization
5. **"The Design of Everyday Things" by Don Norman** — human-centered design principles that apply far beyond products

Start with whichever one intrigues you most. Then follow your curiosity wherever it leads. The returns will be unreasonable.
