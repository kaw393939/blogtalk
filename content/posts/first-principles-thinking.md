excerpt: "Reasoning by analogy is efficient but fragile. First principles thinking is harder, slower, and the only reliable way to arrive at genuinely original conclusions."

Aristotle defined a first principle as "the first basis from which a thing is known." It's the foundation that cannot be deduced from any other proposition — the bedrock of reasoning.

In practice, first principles thinking means decomposing a problem down to its fundamental truths and building your reasoning up from there, rather than reasoning by analogy to what already exists.

Most of us, most of the time, reason by analogy: "This worked before in a similar situation, so it should work here." It's efficient. It's often correct. And it will never produce a genuinely original insight.

## The Analogy Trap

Reasoning by analogy is borrowed thinking. You're importing someone else's conclusions without examining whether their assumptions still hold.

Consider how companies approached electric vehicle design for decades: they took a combustion engine car and swapped in an electric motor. The analogy was car → car. The result was a compromised vehicle that was worse at being electric *and* worse at being a car.

Tesla's insight was to start from first principles: what does a battery pack actually require? What does an electric motor actually enable? If you weren't constrained by the assumption that a car must look and function like existing cars, what would you build?

The answer was a vehicle with a flat battery floor (lower center of gravity), a frunk (no engine up front), over-the-air updates (it's a computer now), and a fundamentally different manufacturing process.

## The Method

First principles thinking follows a three-step pattern:

### 1. Identify Your Assumptions

Every belief you hold rests on a stack of assumptions. Most of them are invisible because they're shared by everyone around you. The first step is making them explicit.

"We need a database for this project." Do you? What are you actually storing? How is it accessed? What guarantees do you actually need?

### 2. Decompose to Fundamentals

Break the problem down until you hit truths that are self-evident or empirically verified. Not opinions. Not best practices. Not "how it's usually done." Actual fundamentals.

The cost of computation decreases exponentially over time. Users have finite attention. Networks have latency. These are fundamentals. "Microservices are the right architecture" is not.

### 3. Reconstruct From the Ground Up

Now build your solution using only the fundamentals as your foundation. This is where the magic happens — and where most people give up, because building from scratch is *hard*. Analogy is comfortable. First principles is exhausting.

But the solutions you arrive at will be ones that no amount of analogical reasoning could have produced.

## When to Use (and When Not To)

First principles thinking is expensive. It requires time, energy, and intellectual honesty. You cannot and should not apply it to every decision.

**Use it when:**
- The problem is genuinely novel
- Existing solutions seem inadequate but everyone keeps using them
- The stakes are high enough to justify the effort
- You suspect hidden assumptions are constraining your thinking

**Don't use it when:**
- The problem is well-understood and standard solutions work fine
- Speed matters more than optimality
- You're in execution mode, not design mode

## The Intellectual Courage Required

There's a social cost to first principles thinking. When you question assumptions that everyone else takes for granted, people get uncomfortable. "That's just how it's done" is a powerful social force, and pushing back against it requires not just intellectual rigor but intellectual courage.

> "The important thing is not to stop questioning." — Albert Einstein

The thinkers who move the world forward are the ones willing to look foolish in the short term by asking "but *why*?" until they hit bedrock. It's uncomfortable. It's inefficient. And it's the only way to think thoughts that haven't been thought before.
