excerpt: "If GPT-4 scores in the top 10% on the bar exam and can compose essays that fool professors, what exactly are we testing? The calculator analogy points toward answers — but the transition will take decades, not semesters."

GPT-3.5 scored in the bottom 10% on the bar exam. GPT-4, released months later, scored in the top 10%. If AI systems can compose essays, solve math problems, and pass professional exams, what does that mean for education?

I've been teaching at NJIT for over two decades, and I can tell you: this question keeps educators up at night. Not because we don't have ideas — but because the institutional machinery of education moves at glacial speed, and the technology is moving at light speed.

## The Calculator Analogy

When calculators became cheap and ubiquitous, math education didn't die — it transformed. We stopped drilling long division and started teaching conceptual understanding and complex problem-solving. The tool handled computation. Humans focused on judgment.

AI may do the same thing for writing, research, and analysis. The tool handles information retrieval and composition. Humans focus on critical thinking, argumentation, and creative expression.

But here's what people forget about the calculator analogy: **that transition took decades.** There were bitter fights about whether calculators should be allowed in classrooms. Some schools banned them entirely. Others embraced them too quickly without rethinking curriculum. The messy middle lasted a generation.

AI will follow a similar pattern.

## What Actually Changes Near-Term (2025-2035)

Forget the utopian visions of education completely reinvented by next Tuesday. Here's what's realistic:

**AI as learning assistant.** AI tutors that provide personalized practice and explanations, freeing teachers for higher-level mentoring. This is already happening and scaling fast.

**Evolved assessment.** Gradual shift toward project-based evaluation, oral exams, and portfolios rather than take-home written work. Not because written work doesn't matter, but because we can no longer verify who wrote it.

**New curriculum focus.** Greater emphasis on prompt engineering and AI collaboration, critical evaluation of AI outputs, ethical reasoning, creativity, and social-emotional skills — the things AI can't do.

**Pilot programs.** Select progressive institutions testing new models, with results informing broader adoption over years and decades, not months.

## The Obstacles Are Enormous

Institutional inertia is the most change-resistant force in education. New assessment methods require consensus among educators, administrators, and policymakers. One-third of humanity remains offline — AI-dependent education could worsen existing inequalities. And developmental research may not support pushing students into career-focused tracks earlier.

Harvard's Howard Gardner suggested that by 2050, technology could make "most cognitive aspects of mind" essentially optional for humans. That's a provocative vision, but it faces decades of practical obstacles before becoming reality.

## What I Tell My Students

I've taught over 10,000 students at NJIT. The ones who succeed in the AI era won't be the ones who can recite facts or produce competent five-paragraph essays — machines do that now. The successful ones will be the people who can:

- **Ask the right questions.** AI gives answers. Knowing what to ask is the human skill.
- **Evaluate AI output critically.** Knowing when the machine is confidently wrong is essential.
- **Synthesize across domains.** AI is good at narrow tasks. Connecting ideas across fields is where humans still dominate.
- **Communicate with other humans.** Persuasion, empathy, negotiation, leadership — these are human-to-human skills that AI augments but doesn't replace.
- **Build things.** Not just consume AI output, but use it as a tool to create something that didn't exist before.

That last point is why I'm evolving our Web Systems program into the Enterprise AI degree. The future belongs to people who can operate the intellectual bulldozer, not people who compete with it.
